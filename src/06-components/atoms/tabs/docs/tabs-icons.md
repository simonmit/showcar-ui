<h2>Tabs with icons<span class="status approved">Approved</span></h2>

Wrapper element for tabs and content should contain `data-tabs` atribute with uniq value. So it is possible to have to diffrent tabs&content elements on page.  
Tabs can be used with any content of your choice.  
`data-section` attribute on tab and content div should match.  
You can also use diffrent icons for tabs. The styles are tailored for 4 or less tabs.

There is no styling for content inside. For a search mask example with responsive behavior for content see <a href="https://autoscout24.github.io/showcar-ui/#search-mask-target">here</a>
